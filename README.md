Thank you for visiting this site! This repository contains a collection of notes for the modules in the first year computer science degree at the University of Warwick. It is entirely student-run, and not affiliated with or endorsed by the University. If at any point we are told this goes against DCS anti-plagiarism guidelines, or any other policy, we will immediately take it down. Additionally, we cannot provide guarantees that all the notes are correct as all content is written by students, however, we will try our hardest to maintain quality.

We would be incredibly grateful for any input of content for the individual pages; if you decide you'd like to help contribute to individual pages, do submit a pull request! This would mean we get full coverage of the content finished faster, and everyone on the course can benefit from high quality shared notes.

Currently, the main contributors to this project are: Akram Ahmad (Repository owner), Edmund Goodman, Justin Tan, Yijun Hu, and Josh Fitzmaurice. If you have any additional questions, or want to become more involved in contributing to this project, please feel free to DM us on WhatsApp or Discord.



Many thanks once again for visiting.

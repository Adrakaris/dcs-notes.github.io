Thank you for visiting this site! This repository contains a collection of notes for the modules in the first year computer science degree at the University of Warwick. It is entirely student-run, and not affiliated with or endorsed by the University.

We would be incredibly grateful for any input of content for the individual pages; if you decide you'd like to help contribute to individual pages, do submit a pull request!

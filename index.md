# Welcome to the Warwick first year Computer Science revision guide

This website is a collection of notes for the modules in the first year computer science degree at the University of Warwick.

It is entirely student-run, and not affiliated with or endorsed by the University. If at any point we are told this goes against DCS anti-plagiarism guidelines, or any other policy, we will immediately take it down. Additionally, we cannot provide guarantees that all the notes are correct as all content is written by students, however, we will try our hardest to maintain quality.

## Notes

### [CS118](cs118/index.md)

### [CS130](cs130/index.md)

More modules will be added as we accumulate notes on them.

## Contributing

We welcome pull requests from anyone who is happy to share their notes, and we will try to provide any attribution you would like for content you contribute.

Currently, all the notes are in markdown (`.md`) format, but we should be able to support any other file formats, for example webpages and PDFs. We would also be very happy to add photographs of written notes, but a benefit of electronic formats is that they can be quickly searched (the `ctrl+f` key is going to be used pretty heavily in open book exams).

### How to make a pull request

1. On GitHub, on the repository's page (https://github.com/arkamnite/dcs-notes.github.io), click the `Fork repository` button
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your computer by running the command `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/cs118.github.io`
3. Create a new branch on your local repository by running the command `git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>`. Naming the branch as a very brief description of what the change entails is helpful for when accepting pull requests.
4. Create a new remote for the upstream repository by running the command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/arkamnite/cs118.github.io`
5. Make your changes/contributions to the repository. This will normally only entail adding files into the appropriate module folder. Then, add and commit your changes to the repository (`git add -A` and `git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>"`)
6. Push your changes to the remote by running the command `git push -u origin <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>`
7. On GitHub, on the repository's page (https://github.com/arkamnite/cs118.github.io), after the changes have been pushed, a "Compare & pull request" will appear. Click on it, then the "Create pull request" button on the screen, and we will be able to merge it in to the repository, or we might ask you to make some changes before we do so

If you are still confused, try Google-Fu on how to make a pull request, or see the "Contact us" section.

## Welcome to the CS130 revision guide

Detailed notes for CS130 can be found [here](./content/INDEX.html)

We are in the process of copying across full notes on CS130, and already have supplementary notes on general proofs, as this year's exam is more likely to include proofs than solution based questions, as it is held online

Proof notes:
 - [Proof approaches](./ProofApproaches)
 - [Types of proof](./TypesOfProof)

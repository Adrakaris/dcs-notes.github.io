### Additional notes

In addition to full notes, there is a condensed "crib sheet", which includes mostly includes definitions, so they don't need to just be rote learnt:

- [General crib sheet](./cribSheet)



Since the exam is held online this year, questions are likely to be more proof than solution based, so we included notes on proofs:
- [Proof approaches](./proofApproaches)
- [Types of proof](./typesOfProof)

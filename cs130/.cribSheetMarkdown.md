## Relations

### Properties of relations

Consider a relation $R : A \rightarrow B$

- A relation is reflexive if $aRa \quad \forall a$, i.e. every element is related to itself
- A relation is symmetric if $aRb \implies bRa \quad \forall a,b$, i.e. all relations are bi-directional
- A relation is antisymmetric if $aRb \and bRa \implies a = b \quad \forall a,b$, i.e. all bi-directional relations are from an item to itself
- A relation is transitive if $aRb \and bRc \implies aRc \quad \forall a,b,c$

### Types of relations

- Equivalence relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive
- Partial order relations are reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive
- Total order relations are partial order relations where every element either relates to is or related to by every other element
- Equivalence classes
  - An equivalence classes is the set of elements within the domain which have all have an equivalence relation to each other
  - The equivalence classes of a relation are all disjoint, and cover the entire set, i.e. they partition the relations input set
  - The set of all equivalence classes for a relation is called the quotient of the input set, as it divides it up into partitions



## Functions

- For a relation to be a function, it must only map values into the co-domain, and each input value must map to exactly one output value
- Function composition $g \circ f (x)$ is applied outwards, resulting in $g(f(x))$
- A function is called injective (one-to-one) if every value in the range is mapped to by only one value in domain. This is formally written as:
   $\forall x,y \in A \quad f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y$
- A function is called surjective (onto) if all the elements in the co-domain are covered in the range. This is formally written as:
  $\forall y \in B, \exists x \in A \quad y = f(x)$
- A function is called bijective if it is both injective and surjective, and only bijective functions have well-defined inverse functions.
- Sets are called equinumerous if there is a bijective function between them. Two sets can be proved to be equinumerous by either defining the function, or writing pseudocode which directly maps one set to the other.



## Graphs

- A set of vertices connected by edges, which can be formally defined as $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is the set of edges, and $E$ is a collection (set allowing multiplicity to allow parallel edges) of 2-tuples, storing the start and end vertices of the edge. In undirected graphs, the tuples are unordered, in directed graphs they are ordered, to indicate direction with the first being start and the second end vertices.

- The set of edges  $E$ can be considered a relation $E : E \rightarrow E$, since $E \subseteq V \times V$.

  - $E$ is a symmetric relation for all undirected graphs
  - $E$ is an irreflexive relation for all graphs without loops

- We can "label" edges and vertices by creating a function which maps the set of edges/vertices to their labels

- Graph isomorphism ($\cong$) is when two graphs are topologically identically, formally:

  Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if there is a bijection $f : V(G)\rightarrow V(H)$ so that, for any $v,w \in V(G)$, the number of edges connecting $v$ to $w$ is the same as the number of edges connecting $f(v)$ to $f(w)$.

- Types of graph:

  - Empty graphs are when there are no edges (but there may be vertices)
  - Complete graphs are when every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, and are written as $K_n$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph
  - Cyclic graphs must contain at least one cycle
  - Bi-partite graphs are when the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects between the two sets (no edges exist between vertices within the same set).
    Complete bi-partite graphs are when every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set, and are written as $K_{n,m}$ where $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of the two sets
  - Planar graphs can be embedded in a 2-D plane with no edges intersecting

- Types of traversals

  - Walks are a finite sequence starting and ending in a vertex, alternating vertices and edges, for example $V_0, (V_0, V_1), V_1, ..., (V_{n-1}, V_n), V_n$, which can be written as $V_0 \rightarrow V_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow V_n$.
  - A path is a walk where no edges are repeated
  - A simple path is a walk where no vertices are repeated
  - A tour is a walk where the start and end vertices are the same
  - A cycle is a tour where no edges are repeated
  - A simple cycle is a tour where no vertices are repeated
  - A vertex is reachable from another vertex if there exists a path between them
    
  - Eulerian cycles are cycles which traverse every edge in the graph exactly once
  - Hamiltonian cycles are cycles which traverse every node in the graph exactly once

- Graph colouring is allocating labels called "colours" to vertices, and is called "proper" when no adjacent vertices have the same colour. A graph is called $k$-colourable if there exists a proper colouring using only $k$ colours

- Subdividing in a graph is adding an additional vertex in the middle of an edge

- Graph theorems

  - Handshaking theorem: The sum of the degrees of every vertex in an undirected graph is twice the number of edges in the graph
  - In an undirected graph, the reachability relation on $V$ is an equivalence relation
  - Bi-partite graphs (and trees) are 2-colourable
  - Euler's (& Hierholzer) theorem: A connected undirected graph contains an eulerian cycle if and only if each vertex has an even degree
  - Kuratowski's theorem: All non-planar graphs contain a subgraph isomorphic to either $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$



## Trees

Five definitions of a tree $T = (V, E)$

- Acyclic and connected
- Acyclic and $|E| = |V|-1$
- Connected and $|E| = |V|-1$
- Connected, but removing any edge makes it disconnected
- Acyclic, but adding any edge between existing vertices makes it cyclic



## Probability

- The probability an event $A$ has of occurring *given* event $B$ occurs can be calculated by:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

- Two events are independent if:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) . P(B) \\
P(A|B) = P(A)
$$

- Bayes theorem is used if we have a hypothesis, and we want to update our evaluation of its likelihood given evidence
  $$
  P(H|E) = \frac{P(H) . P(E | H)}{P(E)}
  $$
  Where $H$ denotes the hypothesis event which might occur, and $E$ denotes the "evidence" which affects the probability of the hypothesis event occurring

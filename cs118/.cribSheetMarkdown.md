## Number systems

### Two's complement

- In order to store negative integer numbers, we don't just add a "sign bit" as we would normally, as then we define both positive and negative values for zero, which wastes space, and can be confusing. Instead, we use "two's complement"
  - Binary representation, but the left-most bit is negative
    ![twosComplement](..\media\twosComplement.png)
  - With eight bits, the smallest value is $10000000_2 = -128_{10}$, and the largest value is $01111111_2 = 127_{10}$ (this is $-2^n $ to $2^n - 1$)

### IEEE-754 floating point

- In order to store decimal numbers, we use "floating point notation", which automatically handles the trade-off between precision and range for storing numbers in a fixed number of bits. This is defined in the IEEE-754 specification ([source](https://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_isoiecfdis60559%7Bed2.0%7Den.pdf)), and explained further [here](https://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html)
- A tool for checking this is [available](https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html)
- For single precision `floats` (`double`s use different sized exponents and mantissas, but operate in the same way) the schema for the number is:
  ![IEEE754main](..\media\IEEE754main.png)
  - The "sign bit" denotes whether the number is positive or negative
  - The "exponent" needs to represent both positive and negative numbers, but it **does not** use two's complement, it instead uses a bias of $127$, meaning you subtract $-127$ from the decimal value to get the exponent. Additionally, $-127_{10} = 00000000_2$ and $128+{10} = 11111111_2$ are reserved special cases. Double precision uses an 11-bit field instead of an 8-bit one, and hence has an offset of $1023$
  - The "fraction/mantissa" represents the precision bits of the number, with the most significant bit being $\frac{1}{2^1}$, then $\frac{1}{2^2}$, and so on. This is taken as the value after the binary point, and in almost all cases, the value before the binary point is one, however, if the exponent is all $0$s, it is $0$ and said to be denormalised.
    As a rule of thumb, calculate the value of the fraction from binary with the reciprocal values, the add one to it
  - The fraction represents the value of the number, and is of fixed precision, for example, 23 bits of information. The exponent then specifies the range of the number.
  - Special values
    - Denormalised, when the exponent is all $0$s, so the number is assumed to have a leading $0$ not a leading $1$ before the binary point, i.e. $0.[fraction]$ not $ 1.[fraction]$
    - Zero, when both the exponent and fraction are all $0$s, so it resolves to $0.0$ . Due to the sign bit, there are both positive and negative zeroes, but they compare as equal
    - Infinity, positive and negative infinities are when the exponent is all $1$s, but the fraction is all $0$s, and the sign bit indicates sign. Since they are actual values in the scheme, we can do operations on them
    - NaN (not a number), when the exponent is all $1$s, and there is a non-zero fraction. These can be used for signalling errors etc.
- An example of this in practice is:
  ![IEEE754example](..\media\IEEE754example.png)
  Note that the "1.(fraction)" denotes a decimal point, not a multiplication operation





## Data types and casting

### Primitive data types

| Name      | Range                                                        | Size    | Default  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------- |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false`                                            | 1 bit   | `false`  |
| `byte`    | $-128$ to $127$                                              | 1 byte  | `0`      |
| `short`   | $-32768$ to $+32767$                                         | 2 bytes | `0`      |
| `char`    | $0$ to $65,535$                                              | 2 bytes | `\u0000` |
| `int`     | $-2,147,483,648$ to $+2,147,483,647$                         | 4 bytes | `0`      |
| `long`    | $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$                                      | 8 bytes | `0L`     |
| `float`   | $-3.4 \times 10^{38}$ and $3.4 \times 10^{38}$ with 6 to 7 significant digits of accuracy | 4 bytes | `0.0f`   |
| `double`  | $-1.7 \times 10^{308}$ and $1.7 \times 10^{308}$ with 14 to 15 significant digits of accuracy | 8 bytes | `0.0d`   |



### Precision and casting

- Sometimes, we may want to change the precision the data type storing a value can support. We do this in a process called (type) casting, of which there are two types
  - Explicit/narrowing casting is when the value is moved to a data type which supports less precision. Data can (possibly) be lost in this operation. This most be indicated with a forced cast, which brackets to show it
  
    ```java
    float wideValue = 3.141f;
    int narrowedValue = (int) wideValue;
    ```
  
  - Implicit/Widening casting is when the value is moved to a data type which supports more precision. No data is lost in this operation. This can be done simply by setting a more precise equal to  the value of a less precise one
  
    ```java
    float narrowValue = 3.141f;
    double widenedValue = narrrowValue;
    ```



## Operator evaluation and precedence

- Lazy and strict operators
  - Lazy operators aren't executed if an earlier operations fully defines the statement, e.g. in an "or" operation, if the first statement is true, the second statement needn't be tested
  - Strict operators execute everything, even if it isn't "needed" to ascertain the logical value of the statement, as state might be mutated in later parts, e.g. `y & (x++ == 4)` would change the value of `x`
  
- Pre-increment and post-increment
  
  - `++i` increments the variable before it is used in an expression (incremented then returned), whereas `i++` increments it after it has been used (returned then incremented). This can affect the output of some expressions
  
- Operator precedence ([additional source](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~willb/cs302/java-operator-precedence.pdf))

  | Letter | Name             | Operations             |
  | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
  | P      | Postfix          | `expr++`, `expr--`     |
  | U      | Unary/Prefix     | `++expr`, `--expr`     |
  | M      | Multiplicative   | `*`, `/`, `&`          |
  | A      | Additive         | `+`, `-`               |
  | S      | Shift            | `>>`,`<<`              |
  | R      | Relational       | `>`,`<`,`<=`,`>=`      |
  | E      | Equality         | `==`,`!=`              |
  | S      | Strict operators | `&`,`|`,`^`            |
  | L      | Lazy operators   | `&&`,`||`              |
  | A      | Assignment       | `=`,`+=`,`-=`,`*=`,... |



## Conditionals

### The switch statement

- `Switch` statements offer a way to select control flow based off the value of a variable as opposed to a boolean condition. In some cases, this can be more simple, and hence preferred over `if` statements

- ```java
  switch (variable) {
          case value_1:
              //If the variable is equal to value_1, execute the code, then exit the statement due to the break statement
              break;
          case value_2:
              //If the variable is not equal to value_1, and is equal to value_2 then execute the code, and continue executing each block until the next break statement occurs, or the statement ends
          case value_3:
              //If the variable is not equal to value_1, and is equal to either value_2 (since it is running through with no break statement) or value_3, then execute the code, then exit the statement due to the break statement
          	break;
          default:
          	//If no cases have been satisfied, or the code runs through due to no break statements, execute the code
  }
  ```

- Both the `break` and `default` sections are optional

- Objects should not be switched on, only primitives, as the equality will compare their memory reference with the `==` operator, rather than calling the `.equals()` function.

- We can reason carefully about what happens in conditionals by writing out the preconditions (similar idea to the explanation above, but easier to do it in boolean expressions to be terse)

- Switch statements are faster than `if..else if.. else` statements when there are a large number of cases, as lookup tables can be used, which are fast



## Object orientated programming

### Pillars of object orientated programming

There is some argument over the number of "pillars", but the four commonly accepted ones are:

- Abstraction
  - "Exposing essential features, whilst hiding irrelevant detail" 
  - Used so that the purpose/interface of a function can be separated from its implementation, making code re-usable, more understandable, and easier to modify (won't break things, changes need to be made in fewer places)
    
  
- Encapsulation
  - "Bundling data and operations that can be performed on that data together - leads to data hiding"
    - Encapsulation is not data hiding, but it does lead to it
    - Making state variables `private` and the methods that act on them `public` is called data hiding
  - "Wrapping data and the code acting on it together as a single unit", so users must use the external interface, rather than just changing things internally.
  - "The action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule", so that an object controls its own internal state, and should only be able to be changed through its interface. This is often implemented through/results in data hiding, which is removing access to variables within a class by making the `private`, and then providing getters and setters, rather than direct access to the data. This means that some internal variables can not be externally changed if no method is provided, and operations such as validation can be performed, instead of just directly changing the data
  - This has the beneficial property of the internal implementation being hidden, so it can be changed and improved without changing the external interface, so other code doesn't break. Additionally, it hides the unnecessary detail of the implementation, and clarifies responsibility for the code
    
  
- Inheritance
  - "Creating new classes from existing ones, reducing programmer effort"
  - "Allowing an object to acquire the properties and methods of another object", so that code can be re-used, along with helping abstractions and hierarchy.
    - A subclass inherits all the properties from its superclass, and may have some additional ones of its own, and/or override some of the parents, however, it must not remove methods from the parent class (known as Liskov substitution principle)
  - Method overriding is when a subclass changes the definition of a function defined by its superclass. It is somewhat like overloading with different numbers of parameters for methods. If a method defined in the superclass is re-defined for the subclass, it will override it. This means that instances of the superclass will run the superclass definition, but those of the subclass will run the subclass definition, without the parent class being modified, and the subclass still retaining all other parent properties without having to redefine them
  - A subclass can only inherit from one superclass, to avoid name-collisions if two superclasses implemented the same method signature differently
  
  
  
- Polymorphism (English definition "the condition of occurring in several different forms")
  
  - Using objects that can take many forms - allows us to invoke operations from derived classes while using a base class reference at run-time
  - "Polymorphism describes its ability to process objects of different types through a single uniform interface"
  - Static polymorphism ([source](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-static-and-dynamic-polymorphism-in-java/))
    - Occurs at compile time, for example method overloading
    - Different behaviour is exhibited by the same method dependent on the input types
    - An example is method overloading
  - Dynamic polymorphism ([source](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-static-and-dynamic-polymorphism-in-java/))
    - Occurs at runtime
    - Allows us to cast objects which are stored in their superclass to their subclass, so we can use their subclass interfaces
      - "Relating to the class hierarchy within a program"
    - An example is method overriding



### SOLID design principles

- Single Responsibility Principle
  - "A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job."
  - Removes "coupling" that would occur if one class encoded two things, as if one of them had to be changed, the other would be forced to to, even if it could stay unchanged if it were not coupled
- Open/Closed Principle
  - “Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
  - This means that you should be able to add new functionality without having to modify existing code
  - This further means that adding new functionality doesn't force you to change any existing interfaces, which would otherwise require changing all calls to instances of the object
- Liskov Substitution Principle
  -  "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it"
  - "Let $\Phi(x)$ be a property provable about objects *x* of type *T*. Then  $\Phi(y)$ should be true for objects *y* of type *S* where *S* is a subtype of *T*."
    - This means that subclasses cannot remove functionality (e.g. implementations of methods) provided by their superclasses, nor impose tighter restrictions on the inputs into or outputs from them
  - This avoids errors which might be caused from casting between super and sub classes
- Interface Segregation Principle
  - "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
  - “Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”
  - If one large general interface is used, and part of it has to be changed, then all other places which rely on it must be changed. If this is split up into multiple smaller interfaces, then only one needs to be changed, and only the places which rely directly on that one interface need be changed
- Dependency Inversion
  - "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, instead, both should depend on the same abstractions
    - Abstractions should only implement high-level logic, not detail, which can then be specified in concretions

## Abstract classes, interfaces, and enumerated types

### Abstract classes

- When superclasses become so generic they contain methods which are only well-defined for their subclasses, they are called "abstract".

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated (so no constructor), but it can be inherited from, acting as a pattern for subclasses

- They can contain a mix of abstract and concrete methods

  - Abstract methods provide the method signature, but not the implementation. All abstract methods must be implemented by any subclasses.
  - Concrete/non-abstract methods are ones which will be the same for all subclasses, so they are fully defined, and will just be inherited as usual into the subclasses

- Typically, abstract classes are used to "provide partial implementation"

- Example:

  ```java
  abstract class GraphicObject {
      //Member variables
      private int x, y;
      
      //No constructor
      
      //A concrete method
      public void moveTo(int newX, int newY) {
          this.x = newX;
          this.y = newY;
      }
      
      //Abstract method
      public abstract void draw();
  }
  
  class Circle extends GraphicObject {
      private int radius;
      
      //Constructor
      public Circle(int radius) {
          this.radius = radius;
      }
      
      //moveTo already implemented through inheritance
      
      public void draw() {
          //Implementation must be provided
          System.out.println("Circle");
      }
  }
  ```

### Interfaces

- If an abstract class contains *only* abstract methods, and no concrete implementations of methods, it is called an "interface"

  - Hence, interfaces have similar properties to abstract classes, including not being able to be instantiated, so having no constructor

- Whilst only one class can be inherited, multiple interfaces can be "implemented". This is to avoid the issue of two superclasses providing different implementations for the same method. The `implements` keyword is used instead of the `extends` one to indicate inheritance/implementation

- Concrete classes implement interfaces, but interfaces can still extend other interfaces to inherit from them

- Typically, interfaces are used to "encapsulate a small subset of functionality"

- Example

  ```java
  interface Foo {
      //No constructor
      
      //Only providing method signatures without implementations
      public void doFoo();
      public void undoFoo();
  }
  
  class Bar implements Foo {
      private int x;
      
      //Provide implementations for all of the interface methods
      public void doFoo() {
          x++;
      }
      
      public void undoFoo() {
          x--;
      }
  }
  ```

  - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html

### Enumerated types

- A special type of class that hold a range of constant values, which can be used instead of defining a large number of final variables

- Example

  ```java
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }
  
  Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
  ```

  - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html



## Exceptions

- The `try..catch..finally` statement
  - The code in the `try` block is executed. If an exception is generated, the appropriate `catch` block is executed
  - Multiple `catch` blocks can be used, but they act like a `switch` statement, moving downwards, selecting the first to match, so if a subclass lies below a superclass, it will never be executed
  - The `finally` block is run irrespective of whether the `catch` was executed, even if there is a `return` within one of the blocks
- The `throws` keyword can be added to a method declaration to indicate that it might "throw" a checked exception of a given type
- The `throw` keyword is used to throw a new exception from a method, and must be followed by an object that is an instance of the Throwable class (e.g. `throw new RuntimeException`)
- In Java all errors and exceptions are subclasses of the `Throwable` class
  - Errors are " serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch". These are rare, so we will largely ignore them
  - Exceptions are "conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch"
- There are two types of exceptions
  - Checked exceptions, which must be caught or re-thrown for the code to compile
  - Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of either `Error` or `RuntimeException`. They do not need to be specifically thrown, and while they can be caught, they don't need to be for compilation
- Custom exceptions can be written
  - The exception should inherit from the most specific exception class that encapsulates it
  - Normally, they are just defined as inheriting from the superclass exception, then overriding the polymorphic constructors to provide appropriate error messages etc.



## Generics

- Generics allow code to enforce strong type checking at compile time, which helps avoid errors such as invalid casting at runtime. Additionally, they minimise the number of type casts needed, as they automatically return data of the specified type, and they allow writing generic algorithms to be tailored to different types
- Primitives cannot be provided as generics, as they are not objects. Instead, we need to use their object wrapper (e.g. `int` becomes `Integer`). Then, if an integer is passed in as a parameter, it will be "autoboxed" into its object wrapper to be handled internally.

# Object Oriented Programming

## The 4 Pillars of OOP

This is a summary of the 4 main sub-topics that we will cover in this chapter/part.

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and operations that can be performed on that data together - leads to data hiding. This is done by using the *access modifiers* (public, protected, private). 
2. **Abstraction**: Exposing essential features, while hiding irrelevant detail
3. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, reducing programmer effort
4. **Polymorphism**: Using objects that can take many forms (different from Generics) - allows us to invoke operations from derived classes while using a base class reference at run-time.

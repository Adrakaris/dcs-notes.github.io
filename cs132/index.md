## Welcome to the CS132 revision guide

These notes will likely take the same/similar form to the CS118 notes. The primary source for these will be from my (Akram) notes; any other sources or contributions will be duly cited/ attributed.

### Topics List

1. [ ] Data representation
2. [ ] Digital logic
3. [ ] Assembler
4. [ ] Memory systems
5. [ ] I/O mechanisms
6. [ ] Processer architecture

### Non-examinable content

In the words of Matt, **all of the above topics are examinable**. However, there are varying degrees of usefulness for each of the topics- if something is not deemed overly useful, it will typically be omitted in the notes. For example, if and when I reach the Processor Architecture topic, there is a likelihood that most proprietary knowledge will be omitted (for example, specific operations of the circuit).

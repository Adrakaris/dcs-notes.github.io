# Variables, Number Systems, and I/O

## Variables

**Variables** are what we store _values_ in. A value can be anything from a primitive value, all the way up to an object instance. They're declared like this:

``` java
// Creating an integer variable
int x = 5;

// Creating a String variable
String str = "I am a string";

// Instantiating a Scanner object and storing it in a variable
Scanner sinput = new Scanner(System.in);

// You can then call Scanner methods like so:
int a = sinput.nextInt();
```

## Number systems

### Two's Complement

Two's complement is the way in which computers represent integers. To get the two's complement negative notation of an integer, you perform the following steps:

1. Write out the number in binary
2. Invert the digits
3. Add one to the result

**It is a given** that if the leftmost bit is a `1`, then **this number is negative**.

**âš  Important:** If you are converting a positive integer _to_ two's complement form, then you simply do a basic conversion. When converting to binary, you only invert the bits if you have a negative number. Similarly, if you see the number `00011110`, this is `30`- you do not need to do the hokey-pokey inversion magic. If you are reading from a binary number, you can either read the basic decimal number _OR_ the decimal from the signed 2's complement. In which case, the number `11111101` would read `253` and `-3` respectively.

For example, given 8 bits and the number -28:
##### Write out the binary form
`28 = 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`
##### Invert the digits
`0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 => 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
##### Add 1
``` 
1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1
              1 +
-----------------
1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
```

### Two's Complement: Converting to decimal
It is therefore also possible to convert _from_ Two's Complement; take the number `0xFFFFFFFF` as an example. This is the hex representation of `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111`.

At first glance, we can tell that **this number is negative**, as it has a leading (leftmost) bit set to `1`.

If you want to see what this number is a negative _of_, then we follow a similar set of steps:

1. Invert all the bits
2. Add one

Therefore, inverting all the bits `0xFFFFFFFF` results in `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000`. Then, adding `1` leads to `0000 0000 0000 0001`, which is the number `1`. Therefore, the _negative_ of `0xFFFFFFFF` is 1, and hence the _value_ is `-1`.

## IEEE 754 notation for floating point numbers

Before we begin, a brief reminder on fractional binary: `9.125 = 101.001`. We achieved this result with the following intuition:

| Binary place values | 2<sup>3</sup> | 2<sup>2</sup> | 2<sup>1</sup> | 2<sup>-1</sup> | 2<sup>-2</sup> | 2<sup>-3</sup> |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| Binary bits| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1|
| Decimal values | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.125 |

The table is a little janky, but it hopefully gets the point across; you continue in descending powers of 2 as you go rightwards. Anything beyond `2^1` is followed by a decimal place, `.`.

### Components of the IEEE 754 Floating Point Number

Before diving into the components, it's much better to look at an example. Therefore, take the decimal number `43.625`; this has binary representation `101011.101`. However, we would represent this as `1.01011101` x 2<sup>5</sup>.


There are three basic components which make up the IEEE 754 floating point number:
1. The **sign of Mantissa**: this is a _single bit_ where a `0` represents a positive number, whilst a `1` represents a negative number.
2. The **biased exponent**: this is an _eight bit_ exponent field which represents both positive and negative exponents. Therefore, the exponent is **127 greater** than the index for 2<sup>a</sup>. For example, given the index 2<sup>5</sup>, the value of the exponent would actually be `a = 5 + 127 = 132 = 10000100 (binary)`
3. The **Mantissa**: this is a _twenty-three bit_ field which makes up the numbers to the **left of the exponent**. However, there is **never a leading 0**. Being binary, we **exclude the first 1** to give us more precision. Therefore, `101011101 => 01011101000000000000000`.

With these components established, we can rewrite our previous example, `43.625`, `1.01011101` x 2<sup>5</sup> in IEEE 754 notation:

| Sign (1 bit) | Exponent (8 bits) | Mantissa (23 bits) | Complete representation |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| `0`          | `100000`          | `01011101000000000000000` | `010000001011101000000000000000` |

### IEEE 754 Double-precision Number

Luckily for our computers, there is also a specification for double-precision numbers; it basically uses the same components, except for the fact that there are more bits.

| Sign (1 bit) (no change) | Exponent (11 bits) (is now **1023 larger**, not 127) | Mantissa (52 bits) | Complete representation is 64 bits |
|-|-|-|-|

### Special values

IEEE 754 also has some special values you need to keep in mind:

The **exponent bits** = `0000 0000`
- If the _fraction_ is `0`, the value is `0` or `-0`.
- Otherwise, renormalise the number with this form: (`-1`)<sup>sign bit</sup> x `0.(fraction)` x 2<sup>-127</sup>

The **exponent bits** = `1111 1111`
- If the _fraction_ is `0`, the value is `+- infinity`.
- Otherwise, the value is `NaN`, otherwise known as **not a number**.

## Output

The main content I gleamed from this was to be familiar with the three Linux streams:

| Stream | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `System.in` | Collect input | `Scanner` uses this stream to collect user input |
| `System.out` | Send normal output | Your typical `System.out.println()` will output to this stream |
| `System.err` | Send output when there is an error | Some IDE's such as Eclipse will output to this stream to highlight text in a different colour |

## Casting

Generally speaking, this is the process of **changing the data type** of one piece of data from one type to another. You need to be familiar with the different types (pun not intended) of casting:

| Flavour | Implicit casting | Explicit casting |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| Definition | No loss of precision | Possible loss of precision |
| Example | `float pi = 3.141f; double big_pi = pi;` | `float pi = 3.141f; int less_pi = pi;` |

The compiler will 'let you know' (otherwise known as screaming) if you attempt an explicit cast; therefore, proper casting syntax is as follows:
`{TYPE} cast_var = {TYPE} original_var`, where `{TYPE}` is the _new_ type you want to cast to.

## Lazy and strict evaluation

You will be familiar with both `&/&&` and `|/||`; if you use either of these, your code will still compile correctly. However, one is **strict** whilst the other is **lazy**. If you need a quick way to remember this, a **SINGLE CHARACTER** means **STRICT** evaluation.

The only difference between a strict and a lazy evaluation is how many of the operands are computed; this means that if you are expecting something to happen on the RHS of a comparison, **only a strict evaluation** will execute the LHs as well as the RHS. In essence, a lazy comparison will only execute both operands if needed.

```java
int a = 5;

// Lazy AND example; the LHS is false, so the overall statement is false. The RHS is not executed, and a = 5.
if (false && (a++ == 5)) {}

// Strict AND example; the LHS is false, but the RHS is still executed. a = 6 after this, even though the result is false.
if (false & (a++ == 5)) {}

// Therefore, a lazy OR operator will not execute the RHS if the LHS is true.
```
## Pre- and Post-increment

There are two ways to increment a numerical variable using the `++` operation:

| Prefix `++var` | Postfix `var++` |
|-|-|
| The value is _incremented first_, and then returned. | The value is _returned first_, and then it is incremented |

I've found that a useful way to remember this is to think of where the `++` is; in the prefix case, the `++` precedes the variable name. Therefore, you can think of the return always happening when you reach the `var`. Hence, prefix `++var` incremements and then returns, whilst postfix `var++` returns and then increments.

## Operator precedence _(BIDMAS on steroids)_

The Java creators realised that they too wanted to implement operator precedence. It follows this order:

| P | U | M | A | S | R | E | S | L | A |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Postfix | Unary | Muliplicative | Additive | Shift | Relational | Equality | Strict Ops | Lazy Ops | Assignment |
| `var++` | `++var` | `* / %` | `+ -` | `<<`| `<= < >= >` | `== !=` | `&` | `&&` | `= += -= *= /= ...`|

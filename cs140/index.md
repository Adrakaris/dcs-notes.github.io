## Welcome to the CS140 revision guide

This module is highly technical in nature, and given the form of previous exam papers, it makes sense to handle each topic one by one and then have a question-answer format for each detail.

Without further ado, here are the lecture topics:
1. [ ] Introductory concepts
2. [ ] Authentication
3. [ ] Password cracking
4. [ ] Cryptography
5. [ ] Public key cryptography (Mathematics)
6. [ ] Digital certificates
7. [ ] Secure email
8. [ ] Authentication protocols
9. [ ] Virtualisation

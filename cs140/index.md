This module is highly technical in nature, and given the form of previous exam papers, it makes sense to handle each topic one by one and then have a question-answer format for each detail.

Without further ado, here are the lecture topics:
1. [ ] Introductory concepts
2. [ ] Authentication
3. [ ] Password cracking
4. [ ] Cryptography
5. [ ] Public key cryptography (Mathematics)
6. [ ] Digital certificates
7. [ ] Secure email
8. [ ] Authentication protocols
